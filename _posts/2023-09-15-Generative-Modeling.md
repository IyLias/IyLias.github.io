## Generative Modeling Framework

* We have sample dataset X

* Suppose sample is generated from unknown distribution, $p_{data}$

* Generative Model $p_{model}$ tries to mimic $p_{data}$. If done, you can generate a sample that appears to have been drawn from the $p_{data}$.


    <U>Which means $p_{model} is approximating real distribution $p_{data}$. </U>
