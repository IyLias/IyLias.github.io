## Complete Graph

A graph $G$ is complete if every two distinct vertices of G are adjacent.

A complete graph of order n is denoted by $K_n$

Therefore $K_n$ has the maximum possible size for a graph with n vertices. Since every 
two distinct vertices of $K_n$ are joined by an edge, the number of pairs of vertices in $K_n$ is $\binom{n}{2}$ = $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
