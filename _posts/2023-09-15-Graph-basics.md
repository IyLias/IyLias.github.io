## Graph

## Subgraph

A graph $H$ is called a subgraph of a graph $G$, written $H$ $\sube$ $G$, if $V(H)$ $\sube$ $V(G)$ and $E(H)$ $\sube$ $E(G)$.


* Proper subgraph
 
    If $H$ $\sube$ $G$ and either $V(H)$ is a proper subset of $V(G)$ or $E(H)$ is a proper subset of $E(G)$, then $H$ is a proper subgraph of $G$.

* Spanning subgraph


    If subgraph of a graph $G$ has the same vertex set as $G$, then it is a spanning subgraph of $G$.



<br>

* Induced subgraph


    A subgraph $F$ of a graph $G$ is called an induced subgraph of $G$ if whenever $u$ and $v$ are vertices of $F$ and $uv$ is an edge of $G$, then $uv$ is an edge of $F$ as well.
