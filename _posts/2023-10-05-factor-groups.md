What is factor group? I've always wondered this kind of group. 


### Theorem. 

Let $\phi: G$ -> $G'$ be a group homomorphism with kernel $H$. Then the cosets of $H$ form a $factor$ $group$, $G/H$, whose binary operation defines the product $(aH)(bH)$ of two cosets by choosing elements $a$ and $b$ from the cosets, and letting $(aH)(bH) = (ab)H$. Also, the map $\mu : G/H$ -> $\phi[G]$ defined by $\mu(aH) = \phi(a)$ is an isomorphism.



<br>

So factor group is a group with elements which are cosets of $G$. 
<br>Factor Group은 Coset들을 원소로 하고 그들을 연산으로 하는 Group 이다.
