# Language Model

A Language Model (LM) is a model that aims to model the phenomenon of language and assigns probabilities to word sequences (sentences).


Expanding on that, a language model is a model designed to identify the most natural word sequences. To assign probabilities to word sequences, the most commonly used approach involves training the language model to predict the next word given the previous words.
