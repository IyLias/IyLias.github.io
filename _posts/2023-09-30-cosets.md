## Theorem 

Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Let the relation ~$_L$ be defined on $G$ by

a ~$_L$ b if and only if $a^{-1}b \in H$

Let ~$_R$ be defined by 

a ~$_R$ b if and only if $ab^{-1} \in H$


Then ~$_L$ and ~$_R$ are both equivalence relations on $G$.


proof) Trivial.. lol


<br>

## Main Idea

Equivalence relation creates a parition of set.



<br>


## Definition: Cosets 


Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. The subset $aH = \{ah | h \in H\}$ of $G$ is the $left \; coset$ of $H$ containing $a$.

While the subset $Ha = \{ha | h \in H \}$ is the $right \; coset$ of $H$ containing $a$.

So it makes a parition from a subgroup.
